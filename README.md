# Remote Control Car with Blynk & Voice Commands 🎮🎤

This project demonstrates how to build and control a remote control car using the **Blynk** app and voice commands via a **Microphone**. The system is powered by a **Raspberry Pi**, which serves as the main controller for both the app-based and voice-based inputs. 

With this project, we aimed to integrate **IoT** technology and **embedded systems** to create a versatile, remote-controlled vehicle that can be easily operated via smartphone or voice, providing convenience, accessibility, and practical application.

## 🚗 Features

- **Blynk App Control:** Control the car from anywhere with a smartphone via the Blynk app.
- **Voice Command Control:** Issue voice commands through a microphone to control the car hands-free.
- **Raspberry Pi Integration:** All commands are processed by a Raspberry Pi, which manages the motors and control system.
- **IoT-Ready:** Connect and control the car over the internet, with real-time responsiveness.

## 🔧 How It Works

- **Blynk App:** A user-friendly interface that connects with the Raspberry Pi over the internet, sending movement commands to the car.
- **Voice Control:** A microphone captures voice input, which the Raspberry Pi processes using speech recognition libraries to convert into control signals for the car.
- **Raspberry Pi:** Acts as the brain of the car, processing input from both the Blynk app and microphone, and sending corresponding signals to the motors.
